elevating Jeff McMillan, a veteran of the New York-based bank, to help guide its implementation of AI across the firm, according to a memo sent Thursday from co-presidents Andy Saperstein and Dan Simkowitz.\\n\\nLast year, Morgan Stanley became the first major Wall Street firm to create a solution for employees based on OpenAI's GPT-4, a project overseen by McMillan.\\n\\nThe move shows the rising importance of artificial intelligence in financial services, sparked by the meteoric rise of generative AI tools that create human-like responses to queries.\\n\\nWhile Wall Street firms broadly pared back jobs last year, they competed to fill thousands of AI positions, poaching employees from one another.\\n\\nIn June, JPMorgan named Teresa Heitsenrether its chief data and analytics officer in charge of AI adoption. At Goldman Sachs, Chief Information Officer Marco Argenti is seen as the lead AI advocate.\\n\\nRead the full Morgan Stanley memo announcing McMillan's new role:\\n\\nWe are pleased to announce that Jeff McMillan has assumed a new position as Head of Firmwide Artificial Intelligence, co-reporting to us.\\n\\nJeff previously led Wealth Management's Analytics, Data and Innovation organization where he played a key role in driving Wealth Management's technological evolution, from our Modern Wealth Management platform to most recently our groundbreaking work with our exclusive partner, OpenAI.\\n\\nIn his new role, Jeff will coordinate across the Firm to ensure we have the appropriate AI strategy and governance in place. In doing so, he will partner with the business units and infrastructure areas to identify and prioritize AI opportunities; help position the Firm within the flow of AI development across the industry and ensure that Morgan Stanley continues to be a well-respected innovator in AI.\\n\\nTo execute on our AI strategy, Jeff will work closely Mike Pizzi, Head of U.S. Banks and Technology, Sid Visentini, Head of Firm Strategy and Katy Huberty, Head of Global Research. Katy and Jeff will co-chair the Firmwide AI Steering Group, comprised of business unit and infrastructure representatives.\\n\\nPlease join us in congratulating Jeff on his new role.\\n\\nwatch now\\n\\nVIDEO\\n\\n9:26\\n\\n09:26\\n\\nMorgan Stanley testing an OpenAI-powered chatbot\\n\\nNews Videos\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe to CNBC PRO\\n\\nSubscribe to Investing Club\\n\\nLicensing & Reprints\\n\\nCNBC Councils\\n\\nSupply Chain Values\\n\\nCNBC on Peacock\\n\\nJoin the CNBC Panel\\n\\nDigital Products\\n\\nNews Releases\\n\\nClosed Captioning\\n\\nCorrections\\n\\nAbout CNBC\\n\\nInternships\\n\\nSite Map\\n\\nAd Choices\\n\\nCareers\\n\\nHelp\\n\\nContact\\n\\nNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?

real estate, infrastructure and exports.\\n\\nIn response, Beijing has ramped up its efforts to bolster manufacturing and domestic tech in a bid to modernize its economy and remain globally competitive.\\n\\nIn this article\\n\\nHSBA-GB\\n\\nFollow your favorite stocksCREATE FREE ACCOUNT\\n\\nThe Hong Kong observation wheel and the HSBC building in Victoria Harbour in Hong Kong.\\n\\nUcg | Universal Images Group | Getty Images\\n\\nHSBC is \"very positive\" about the mid- to long-term outlook for the Chinese economy despite current headwinds, the British bank\\'s chief financial officer told CNBC.\\n\\nGrowth in China has been weighed down over the past year by a slump in the country\\'s traditional economic pillars of real estate, infrastructure and exports. This prompted Beijing to ramp up its efforts to bolster manufacturing and domestic tech in a bid to modernize its economy and remain globally competitive.\\n\\nSpeaking to CNBC\\'s Karen Tso on Wednesday, HSBC CFO Georges Elhedery said the lender â which is headquartered in London but does a lot of its business in Hong Kong and across the Asia-Pacific â was confident that the world\\'s second-largest economy would overcome its short-term headwinds.\\n\\n\"We\\'re looking at major economic transition, which is taking place, which gives us very strong grounds to be very positive about the medium- and long-term outlook,\" Elhedery said.\\n\\nHe suggested that China\\'s economic maturity has reached such a stage that now is the \"right time to transition into what more mature economies are.\"\\n\\nElhedery characterized this maturity as being more heavily reliant on consumers, the services industry and high-value and sustainability-driven products, such as electric vehicles and batteries, aspirations he said were evidenced by the Chinese government\\'s recent massive push toward these sectors.\\n\\nwatch now\\n\\nVIDEO\\n\\n5:30\\n\\n05:30\\n\\nVery positive about the medium and long-term outlook on China: HSBC CFO\\n\\nSquawk Box Europe\\n\\n\"That transition will mean that China will avoid falling in this middle income trap and be able to continue the growth pattern,\" he added.\\n\\n\"Some of the Western economies have gone through those transitions in the past, [and] China is going through a transition today. That gives us a lot of positive outlook for the medium- to long-term for China.\"\\n\\nThe more immediate economic challenges may last \"a few quarters to a couple of years,\" Elhedery said, but expressed confidence that China will be in a better position for the long run, as the country puts itself on a \"materially better forward-looking track.\"\\n\\nHSBC missed its full-year 2023 pretax profit forecasts on the back of a $3 billion write-down on its 19% stake in China\\'s Bank of Communications, while the lender cut its overall exposure to Chinese commercial real estate by $4.6 billion year on year.\\n\\nYet, Elhedery on Thursday insisted that most of the challenges related to the ailing Chinese property market were \"behind us,\" even as he said the sector is not \"out of the woods\" so far.\\n\\n\"We think the trough of that sector is behind us. We think in our case, our exposure and our ECL (expected credit losses) covers the bulk of the charges behind us, but that still means there will be lingering effects as the sector continues to adjust, and we may continue to see some impact but not to the tune that we\\'ve seen last year on our credit charges,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe to CNBC PRO\\n\\nSubscribe to Investing Club\\n\\nLicensing & Reprints\\n\\nCNBC Councils\\n\\nSupply Chain Values\\n\\nCNBC on Peacock\\n\\nJoin the CNBC Panel\\n\\nDigital Products\\n\\nNews Releases\\n\\nClosed Captioning\\n\\nCorrections\\n\\nAbout CNBC\\n\\nInternships\\n\\nSite Map\\n\\nAd Choices\\n\\nCareers\\n\\nHelp\\n\\nContact\\n\\nNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?
